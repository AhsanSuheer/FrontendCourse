      <p>
         Reports are coming in that people absolutely love these furry boys. We
         think that this may be an important part of why they are so cute,
         however we need more data.

        <h4>Is it their energy?</h4>
        <p>
          People have forever been complaining that these good boys are just
          too energetic. They jump and jump and roll until they're almost tired,
          but then they roll some more.

        <h4>Is it their <a href = "#">tongues</a>?</h4>
        <p>
          People have also been complaining that these floofs are completely
          incapable of controlling their tongues. They just really can't stop
          being happy, ever.
